    gettingStarted: [
      `I've been lucky enough to have had access to computers since I was three years old. For as long as I can remember, every Sunday I would head to breakfast with my father and his friends as they discussed for hours all the latest technology (particularly antiviruses and vulnerabilities).`,

      `Thanks to the past experiences I had with my father, I'm both happy and humbled to be able to educate myself further on what made all my past childhood experiences possible, along with the efforts and resources spent to make the internet as we know it run today.`

    hobbies: [
      `I divide my spare time between exploring the offerings of the Pacific Northwest, creating small-scale web applications, rock climbing, and single-origin pourover coffee.`
